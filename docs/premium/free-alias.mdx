### What's an alias?
-  An alias is an extra profile username & link you can get that redirects to your main profile.
In other words, an alias is a second username you can claim for your account, that would still redirect to your main profile page.

### How to claim your alias
To claim your profile alias:
- Head over to [Settings](https://emogir.ls/dashboard/settings) on your profile.
- Click on [Manage Aliases](https://emogir.ls/dashboard/settings/aliases). 
- Add a new alias
- Save

Now you can open your profile using either your main profile link or your alias link.

## Information
- If you remove an alias, you'll be on a 6 hour cooldown before being able to change your alias again. This is to help protect the website from abuse and API spamming.
